## Getting Started

VoTT can be installed as a native application or run from source.

### Download and install a release package for your platform (recommended)

VoTT is available for Windows, Linux and OSX. Download the appropriate platform package/installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT/releases). `v2` releases will be prefixed by `2.x`.

### Build and run from source

VoTT requires [NodeJS (>= 10.x, Dubnium) and NPM](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT.git
    cd VoTT
    git checkout v2
    npm install
    npm start
   ```

   **Important:** When running locally with `npm`, both the electron and the browser versions of the application will start. One major difference is that electron can access the local file system.

## V1 & V2

VoTT V2 is a refactor and refresh of the original Electron-based application. As the usage and demand for VoTT grew, V2 was started as an initiative to improve and make VoTT more extensible and maintainable. In addition, V2 uses more modern development frameworks and patterns (React, Redux) and is authored in TypeScript.

A number of code quality practices have been adopted, including:

* Code Linting
* Unit tests & mocks (Jest, Enzyme)
* [Code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/Microsoft/VoTT) ([CodeCov.io](https://codecov.io/))
* [Complexity analysis](https://vottv2.z5.web.core.windows.net/) ([Plato](docs/PLATO.md))

All V2 efforts are on the [v2](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT/tree/v2) branch. The git history for V1 and V2 have significantly diverged; when V2 is complete, master will be updated to reflect V2.

### Where is V1?

Master still reflects the V1 codebase - any fixes or updates can still be made there.  Likewise, all 1.x releases can still be found under [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT/releases).

### Can I use my V1 project in V2?

Yes you can! There is support for converting a V1 project into V2 format, but only for V1 projects that have only picture assets. Video assets from V1 are not yet supported. For a smooth experience, it is recommended that you keep your current V1 project (JSON) file in a directory with all your images for that project. When you open the JSON file, you will asked to confirm that you would like to convert your project and then you will be directed to the editor screen. In this process, a `.vott` file will be generated in the same project directory and you can use this as your project file from now on. It is recommended that you back up your V1 project file before converting the project.

## Using VoTT

### Creating Connections

VoTT is a 'Bring Your Own Data' (BYOD) application. In VoTT, connections are use to configure and manage source (assets to labeled) and target (where labels should be exported to) data sources.

Connections can be setup and shared across projects. Connections have been designed using an extensible provider model -- new source/target providers can easily be added.

Currently, VoTT supports:

* [Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)
* [Bing Image Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api/)
* Local File System

To create a new connection, click the `New Connections` icon, in the left hand navigation bar:

![alt text](docs/images/new-connection.png "New Connection")

### Creating a New Project

Labeling workflows in VoTT revolve around projects - a collection of configuration and settings that are persisted.

Projects define a source and target connection, as well as project metadata - including tags to be used when labeling source assests.

As mentioned above, all projects require a source and target connection:

* **Source Connection** - Where to pull assests from
* **Target Connection** - Where project files and exported data are stored

![alt text](docs/images/new-project.png "New Project")

#### Project Settings

Project settings can be modified after a project has been created, by clicking on the `Project Setting` icon in the left hand navigation bar.

#### Security Tokens

Some project settings can include sensitive values, such as API keys or other shared secrets. Each project will generate a security token that can be used to encrypt/decrypt sensitive project settings.

Security tokens can be found under `Application Settings` by clicking the gear icon in the lower corner of the left hand navigation bar.

**NOTE:** Project files can be shared among multiple people. In order to share sensitive project settings, *all parties must have/use the same security token.*

The token name and key **must** match in order for sensitive values to be successfully decrypted.

![alt text](docs/images/security-tokens.png "Security Tokens")

### Labeling an Image

When a project is created or opened, the main tag editor window opens. The tag editor consists of three main parts:

* A resizeable preview pane that contains a scrollable list of images and videos, from the source target
* The main editor tool that allows tags to be applied to drawn regions
* The tags editor pane that allows user to modify, lock, reorder, and delete tags

Selecting an image or video on the left will load that image in the main tag editor. Regions can then be drawn on the loaded asset and a tag can be applied.

As desired, repeat this process for any additional assets.

![alt text](docs/images/label-image.png "Image Tagging")

### Labeling a Video

Labeling a video is much like labeling a series of images. When a video is selected from the left, it will begin automatically playing, and there are several controls on the player, as seen here:
![alt text](docs/images/video-player.png "Video Player")

In addition to the normal video playback controls, there are two extra pairs of buttons.

On the left, there are the previous and next frame buttons. Clicking these will pause the video, and move to the next appropriate frame as determined by the project settings. For example, if the project settings have a frame extraction rate of 1, these buttons will cause the video to be moved back or forward 1 second, while if the frame extraction rate is 10, the video will be moved back or forward a tenth of a second.

On the right, there are the previous and next tagged frame buttons. Clicking these will pause the video and move to the next or previous frame that has a previously tagged region on it, if a tagged frame exists.

Colored lines will also be visible along the video's timeline. These indicate the video frames that have already been visited. A yellow line denotes a frame that has been visited only, while a green line denotes a frame that has been both visited and tagged. The colored lines can be clicked for quick navigation to the indicated frame.

The timeline can also be used to manually scrub through the video to an arbitrary point, though the project settings for frame extraction rate are always obeyed. Pausing the video will move to the closest frame according to this project setting. This way, a very low frame extraction rate, such as 1 frame per second, can be set for sections of the video known to contain few taggable items, and a much higher frame extraction rate, such as 30 frames per second, to allow fine-grained control.

Tagging and drawing regions is not possible while the video is playing.

### Exporting Labels

Once assets have been labeled, they can be exported into a variety of formats:

* [Azure Custom Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/)
* TensorFlow (Pascal VOC and TFRecords)
* VoTT (generic JSON schema)

In addition, users may choose to export

* all assets
* only visited assets
* only tagged assets

Click on the `Export` icon in the left hand navigation. Select the appropriate export provider and which assets to export.

![alt text](docs/images/export-labels.png "Export Labels")

### Keyboard Shortcuts

#### Tag Shortcuts

VoTT allows a number of keyboard shortcuts to make it easier to keep one hand on the mouse while tagging. It allows most common shortcuts:

* Ctrl+C - copy
* Ctrl+X - cut
* Ctrl+V - paste
* Ctrl+A - select all
* Ctrl+Z - undo
* Ctrl+Shift+Z - redo

#### Tag Ordering

The editor page assigns hotkeys of 1 through 0 to the first ten tags. These can be reordered by using the up/down arrow icons in in the tag editor pane.

![alt text](docs/images/reorder-tag.png "Reorder Tags")

#### Tag Locking

One can also lock a tag by combining `Ctrl` and the tag hotkey, ie. `Ctrl+2` would lock tag #2.

#### Editor Shortcuts

In addition, the editor page has some special shortcuts to select tagging tools:

* V - Pointer/Select
* R - Draw Rectangle
* P - Draw Polygon
* W or ArrowUp - Previous Asset
* S or ArrowDown - Next Asset
* Ctrl+S - Save Project
* Ctrl+E - Export Project

When the video playback bar is present, it allows the following shortcuts to select frames:

* A or ArrowLeft - Previous Frame
* D or ArrowRight - Next Frame
* Q - Previous Tagged Frame
* E - Next Tagged Frame
